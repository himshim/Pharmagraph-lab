# 📊 PharmaGraph Lab

PharmaGraph Lab is a **web-based graphing tool** designed for pharmaceutical sciences and analytical chemistry.  
It was created because many older laboratory instruments still produce **manual readings** rather than digital reports.  
Making manual graphs in spreadsheets for publications is time-consuming, error-prone, and does not look professional.

This project provides a **modern, open-source, mobile-friendly web app** where you can enter raw readings and instantly generate professional-looking plots that mimic instrument outputs.

## ✨ Features

- 📈 **Multiple chart types** – Line, Area, Bar, Scatter.
- ⚗️ **Instrument presets** – HPLC chromatograms, UV–Vis spectra, titration curves, dissolution profiles.
- 🖊️ **Manual data entry** – Paste or type raw readings, or load CSV.
- 🎨 **Chart skins** – Classic, Dark Lab, Minimal.
- 📐 **Fixed aspect ratios** – Export consistent 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:2 charts across devices.
- 📝 **Metadata editor** – Add instrument, method, sample ID, analyst, and date.
- 🔧 **Export toggles** – Choose what metadata appears on the PNG (title, sample ID, date, etc.).
- 📤 **One-click export** – Save clean, publication-ready PNG graphs.
- 📱 **Responsive UI** – Works on both desktop and mobile.
- 🌐 **Free hosting** – Built with React + Vite + Tailwind, deployable on Vercel.

## 🧪 Use Case

This project was created as a **hobby project** to solve a real gap:

> Some instruments in pharma/chemistry labs (e.g., UV–Vis, titration burettes, dissolution testers) still give only **manual readings**.  
> Creating graphs in Excel or Origin feels outdated and unprofessional for modern reports.  
> PharmaGraph Lab provides a lightweight, web-based, professional alternative.

## 💡 Roadmap Ideas

- [ ] PDF export with full report layout
- [ ] CSV upload (drag-and-drop)
- [ ] Multi-series comparison (e.g., Batch A vs Batch B)
- [ ] Additional instrument presets (IR spectra, NMR, etc.)
- [ ] Save/load projects in browser
- [ ] PWA offline support
